    "#### Page iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "We should first iterate over each page of clips.  The url for each page is https://www.pbs.org/newshour/video/page/<strong>PAGE_NUMBER</strong>.  As of typing, there are 980 pages of clips.  The videos for each page appear to be stored in `<div id=\"all-videos\"> ... </div>`.  Of course the link to each clip is stored in a `<a href=\"URL\"> ... </a>` block.  This is very convenient!\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Note</u>: One tricky part is I must skip full episodes shown on the page.  Full episodes contain no transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transcript scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we arrive at a clip we want a few things: (1) page URL, this will be nice for debugging, (2) text stored under \"Story\", this is essentially the summary of the clip, (3) date and time, (4) video title, (5) transcript.  Let's attack each of these strategically.  It's important to note some clips don't have transcripts ([example](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/voices-from-sandy-madeleine-conway-breezy-point)) and some clips have blank transcripts ([example]())\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Note</u>: It would also be nice to get video tags if that's availiable.  Such as politics, opinion, technology, etc.\n",

    "#### 1.) Page URL\n",

    "We already have this info since we arrived at the proper page!\n",

    "#### 3.) Date and time\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to be stored in a `<time> ... </time>` block.  I wasn't even aware this existed in HTML, hopefully it's unique for each clip page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks like it might need some formatting later, but let's worry about that then and just store it as a string for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.) Title\n",
    "\n",
    "This is stored in a `<h1> ... </h1>` block.  It's actually the only other child of (3)'s parent.  We should get both pieces of info at once\n",
